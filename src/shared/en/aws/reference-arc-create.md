# `npx create`

Reads `.arc` and generates AWS infrastructure if it does not already exist. This command is intended to be run and re-run as you develop your app and modify the corresponding `.arc` file. Some AWS resources can take a few minutes to create so be patient. 🐢 It's worth it! 

> 🐇 Note: This method can throw errors related to AWS account throttling – if this happens, don't be alarmed! Just wait a few seconds are re-run the command. It just means you're working faster than your AWS account is provisioned to handle. If this problem persists contact AWS support to get a rate limit increase. 🚀
