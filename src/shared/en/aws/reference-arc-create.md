# `npx create`

Reads `.arc` and generates AWS infrastructure if it does not already exist. This command is intended to be run and re-run as you develop your app and modify the corresponding `.arc` file.

> Note: This method can throw errors related to AWS account throttling â€“ if this happens, don't be alarmed! Just wait a few seconds are re-run the command.
