# `npm run inventory`

## `npm run inventory verify`

Running `npm run inventory verify` verifies AWS resources for the current `.arc` file exist.

## `npm run inventory nuke`

Running `npm run inventory nuke` deletes all AWS resources for the current `.arc` file except for **DynamoDB tables** and **Local code**. DynamoDB tables can be deleted with an additional environment variable (explained below). Your local code is yours to manage, but moreso, this means the `nuke` workflow allows for quick setup and teardown of a codebase across infra deployments. 

## `ARC_NUKE=tables npm run inventory nuke`

Running `ARC_NUKE=tables npm run inventory nuke` deletes all DynamoDB tables for the current `.arc` file.
